What's your use case?

## Brochure Website

You've got a new product or service on the market, and you need to make sure that you've got an online presence to back it up. Traist will build you an *attractive, informative, and understandable* design, which you can quickly and easily load your copy and images into without coding knowledge. We operate on a 'mobile first' principle, meaning that your users can expect an outstanding experience, whichever device they're using.

## Simple Site

You need a website with a bit more oomph than a brochure site - maybe a few pages with your company profile, a range of service offerings, and maybe a contact us page? We'll build you a solution that integrates modern design with tried and tested principles to make sure your users have the best possible experience.

## Dynamic Site

You need to update your site frequently with new information, such as blogging, etc? Then we'll build you a dynamic site with quick and easy options for adding, updating, and removing content from your site.

## eCommerce Site

We'll build you a web shop

## Custom Application
